##  TDD the way it's often done...

I see a lot of this sort of thing:
* Think up a design
* Write a bunch of tests that say the design exists
* Write the implementation
* Test, debug, test, debug, test, debug, test, debug, debug, test, debug, test, debug <!-- .element: style="white-space: nowrap" -->
*  Write a TODO saying to refactor
