##  Missing a trick

TDD is about **detailed feedback** on ** design choices**
* Time spent thinking about a solution is time spent not getting feedback
* Feedback comes from running tests

* Run tests **early**
 - No, *much* earlier than than
* Run tests **often**
 - No, *much* more often than that
