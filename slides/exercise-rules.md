##  Rules for Adding Code

Be *very strict* about this:
* Only add code to make a failing test pass
* Only add brand-new code to test methods in a test class
* Only create new non-test methods by “extract method”
* Only create new classes as destinations for “move method” 

Work in pairs, “navigator” to keep you honest
